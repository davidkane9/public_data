# Overview

I use this repository to hold data that I use in blog posts and other public activities. I also document, albeit casually, their provenance. At some point, I might organize all this as a proper R package, but not today.

To access this data, the correct file path is:   https://github.com/davidkane9/public_data/raw/master/   
followe by the file name with extension.

## fifa_player_list_1.pdf

A PDF listing all the players in the 2018 World Cup. FIFA put out several versions of this list. I suspect that getting this data from Wikipedia is a better idea.

## uahncdc_lt_6.0.txt

Satelite temperature data through June 2018. Downloaded from [here](https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/v6.0/tlt/uahncdc_lt_6.0.txt), which seems to be the location in which a new file is placed each month. I came to this link from Roy Spencer's [blog post](http://www.drroyspencer.com/2018/07/uah-global-temperature-update-for-june-2018-0-21-deg-c/).

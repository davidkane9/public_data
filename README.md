# Overview

I use this repository to hold data that I use in blog posts and other public activities. I also document, albeit casually, their provenance. At some point, I might organize all this as a proper R package, but not today.

## fifa_player_list_1.pdf

A PDF listing all the players in the 2018 World Cup. FIFA put out several versions of this list. I suspect that getting this data from Wikipedia is a better idea.
